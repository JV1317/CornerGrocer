CS210 Project 3 submission

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

<p> For this project we used both Python and C++ to create a project that will read data from a file and based on a users input selection perform actions upon that data. For instance if the user selects option one the program will produe a list of all itmes purchaed for the days and their quantitiies. We used C++ to display the menu and control the flow of the program while we used Python to perform the data analytics and perform actions on the data. </p>

### What did you do particularly well?

<p> I thought I did a particularly good job at dividing up the code and defining functions in Python and using C++ to display the menu and control the flow of the program. </p>

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

<p> I think I could have done a better job of validating the users input. I caused the program to exit after the user entered an invalid input when I sould have looped back and allowed the user to attempt their input again. </p>

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

<p> The most challenging aspect of this project to me was printing the histogram. I found this the most challenging because I was a bit rusty and i overcame this by going back and reading through our class text as well as researching fstream and sstream libraries.  </p>

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

<p> Being able to link libraries to use multiple programming languages for one project is a skill that I plan to take beyond this class and is a skill that I plan on refining and honing to deploy on future projects. </p>

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

<p> I attempted to make this project maintainable by organizing the code into files. To make the project readable I used consistent naming conventions and syntax. By including a second programming languare and expecially one as extensible as Python we have made this program very adaptable. </p>
